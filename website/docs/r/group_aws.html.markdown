<a id="network-interface"></a>
## Network Interfaces

Each of the `network_interface` attributes controls a portion of the AWS
Instance's "Elastic Network Interfaces". It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with [AWS's Elastic Network
Interfaces docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html)
to understand the implications of using these attributes.

* `network_interface_id` - (Optional) The ID of the network interface.
* `device_index` - (Optional) The index of the device on the instance for the network interface attachment.
* `subnet_id` - (Optional) The ID of the subnet associated with the network string.
* `description` - (Optional) The description of the network interface.
* `private_ip_address` - (Optional) The private IP address of the network interface.
* `security_group_ids` - (Optional) The IDs of the security groups for the network interface.
* `delete_on_termination` - (Optional) If set to true, the interface is deleted when the instance is terminated.
* `secondary_private_ip_address_count` - (Optional) The number of secondary private IP addresses.
* `associate_public_ip_address` - (Optional) Indicates whether to assign a public IP address to an instance you launch in a VPC. The public IP address can only be assigned to a network interface for eth0, and can only be assigned to a new network interface, not an existing one.


<a id="block-devices"></a>
## Block Devices

Each of the `*_block_device` attributes controls a portion of the AWS
Instance's "Block Device Mapping". It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with [AWS's Block Device
Mapping docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/block-device-mapping-concepts.html)
to understand the implications of using these attributes.

Each `ebs_block_device` supports the following:

* `device_name` - The name of the device to mount.
* `snapshot_id` - (Optional) The Snapshot ID to mount.
* `volume_type` - (Optional) The type of volume. Can be `"standard"`, `"gp2"`, or `"io1"`.
* `volume_size` - (Optional) The size of the volume in gigabytes.
* `iops` - (Optional) The amount of provisioned
  [IOPS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-io-characteristics.html).
  This must be set with a `volume_type` of `"io1"`.
* `delete_on_termination` - (Optional) Whether the volume should be destroyed on instance termination.
* `encrypted` - (Optional) Enables [EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) on the volume.

Modifying any `ebs_block_device` currently requires resource replacement.

Each `ephemeral_block_device` supports the following:

* `device_name` - The name of the block device to mount on the instance.
* `virtual_name` - The [Instance Store Device Name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html#InstanceStoreDeviceNames)
  (e.g. `"ephemeral0"`).

~> **NOTE:** Currently, changes to `*_block_device` configuration of _existing_
resources cannot be automatically detected by Terraform. After making updates
to block device configuration, resource recreation can be manually triggered by
using the [`taint` command](/docs/commands/taint.html).


<a id="third-party-integrations"></a>
## Third-Party Integrations

* `rancher_integration` - (Optional) Describes the [Rancher](http://rancherlabs.com/) integration.

    * `master_host` - (Required) The URL of the Rancher Master host.
    * `access_key` - (Required) The access key of the Rancher API.
    * `secret_key` - (Required) The secret key of the Rancher API.
